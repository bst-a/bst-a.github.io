Birthday Cake 2D Animation with Interactive Candles

This is an interactive web project where users can input their age, and a 2D birthday cake with candles is generated dynamically.
Users “blow” the candles by clicking a button, triggering candle extinguishing animations, smoke effects, and confetti. 
When all candles are blown out, a celebratory popup appears with a random cute animal image and a “Happy Birthday” sound.
The project features responsive design for desktop and mobile, animated balloons, and customizable visuals for the cake, candles, and popup.
